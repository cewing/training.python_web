Minutiae
--------

:Objectives:

    This course emphasizes distributed programs and web applications - how
    they work and how to program them in Python. Students will explore the
    underlying principles and their expression in Python libraries. Students
    will learn contrasting approaches in creating applications: programming
    with the low-level libraries versus using highly integrated frameworks.
    All topics will be presented with a focus on solving real problems with
    simple, pragmatic code.


:Prerequisites:

    Students should have previously completed `Programming in Python
    <http://www.pce.uw.edu/courses/programming-python/downtown-seattle-autumn-2012/>`_
    or have an equivalent level of experience. Contact the instructor prior to
    registering if not in the `certificate program
    <http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/python-programming.html>`_


:Requirements:

    This course does not provide a computer laboratory. Students will be
    required to have access to a computer in order to complete the coursework.
    As in-class laboratories are an important part of the experience, students
    should have a portable computer they can bring to each session. Networking
    in the classroom is provided via WiFi. Students should be able to
    configure their computers to connect to the network.


:Assessment:

    The course is graded Pass/Fail, based on **satisfactory completion of
    required programming assignments** and classroom presentations.
    **Attendance is required**; more than two unexcused absences will result
    in a Fail.


:Accommodation:

    The University of Washington is committed to providing access and
    reasonable accommodation in its services, programs, activities, education
    and employment for individuals with disabilities. For information or to
    request disability accommodation contact: Disability Services Office:
    206.543.6450/V, 206.543.6452/TTY, 206.685.7264 (FAX), or e-mail at
